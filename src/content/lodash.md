# YOU MIGHT NOT NEED LODASH

Lodash is a great library, well crafted, battle tested and with a strong team.  
Just to be clear: **You should use Lodash** - just make sure you import the bits you need, not the whole library to use one method.  

This page is a mere exercise to see how can achieve the same functionalities in plain js: sometimes it's nice to understand the nitty gritty details of what we are building or how stuff works behind the hood.

**The project is far from complete: this is the [list of Lodash methods left](/lodash/missing).
